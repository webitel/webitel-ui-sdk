# How to make fix in release

## Sometimes there is a situation when you need to make a fix in an already released version of the application.
In this example, I'll use v23.09 as the current release (the one in which I want to make changes). Your version probably will be different.

### Follow these steps
1. Check out to the v23.09 branch.

2. Make a new branch from v23.09.

3. Make your changes and push them to the repository.
  
4. Make a pull request to the v23.09 branch.

### Important!!!
The pull request changes should only contain fixes for the old functionality. Changing the code formatting is not allowed. Keep an eye on this.
